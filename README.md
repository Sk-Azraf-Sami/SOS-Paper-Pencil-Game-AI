## [Description](#description)

SOS is a traditional paper-pencil game where players take turns writing either an 'S' or an 'O' on a grid to form the word "SOS" horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This AI-based SOS game enhances the original game with artificial intelligence algorithms to provide different levels of difficulty:

- **Easy**: Uses Fuzzy Logic to make AI decisions.
- **Medium**: Leverages a Genetic Algorithm to simulate intelligent moves.
- **Hard**: Utilizes the A* (A-star) search algorithm for optimal pathfinding strategies.
- **Very Hard**: Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for competitive gameplay in AI vs. Human mode.

The game also supports **AI vs. Human** and **Human vs. Human** play modes.
