The choice of algorithm for each difficulty level in the SOS game can be subjective and depends on the complexity and efficiency of the algorithm. Here's a suggestion:

1. **Easy Mode**: Fuzzy Logic - This is a simple and intuitive algorithm that can be used to make decisions based on predefined rules. It's not as precise or optimal as other algorithms, which makes it suitable for an easy difficulty level.

2. **Medium Mode**: Genetic Algorithm - This is a search heuristic that is inspired by the process of natural selection. It can find solutions to optimization problems by evolving a population of individual objects over time. It's more complex and can provide better results than fuzzy logic, but it's not as efficient or optimal as A* or Minimax.

3. **Hard Mode**: A* Algorithm - This is an efficient and optimal pathfinding algorithm. It's more complex and provides better results than both fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. It's suitable for a hard difficulty level because it can make the computer player very challenging to beat.

4. **Very Hard Mode**: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning - This is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. With alpha-beta pruning, the algorithm becomes more efficient by ignoring branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. This makes it the most complex and challenging algorithm among the four, suitable for a very hard difficulty level.

Remember, these are just suggestions and the actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specifics of your game.


Origin: 
The game "SOS" was discovered and popularized in Turkey. It is a paper-and-pencil game typically played by two players. Each player takes turns writing either an "S" or an "O" on a grid, with the objective of forming the sequence "SOS" either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game gained popularity in Turkish schools and has been enjoyed by children and adults alike. While its exact origins are not well-documented, Turkey is widely recognized as the country where SOS became a well-known pastime.

Game Rule: 
SOS is a two player game.
The players have the option to put either S or O at an empty square.
Each turn plays one player.
If a player makes an SOS sequence that player plays another turn.
The game ends when all squares are filled out.
The player which will make the most SOS sequences wins.


Creating installation files for your SOS game on both Windows and Ubuntu involves a few steps. We can use tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to package your Python script and its dependencies into an executable. Here are the steps for both platforms:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project
Ensure your project directory is organized, and you have a requirements file listing all dependencies.

#### Directory Structure:
```
sos_game/
│
├── main.py
├── resources/
│   ├── music/
│   └── images/
└── requirements.txt
```

#### `requirements.txt`:
List all necessary Python packages:
```
pygame
tkinter
```

### Step 2: Create Executable for Windows
1. **Install PyInstaller**:
    ```sh
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2. **Create Executable**:
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```sh
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
    ```
    This will generate a `dist` folder containing `main.exe`.

3. **Bundle Dependencies**:
    Ensure all resources (images, music, etc.) are included in the distribution. You might need to tweak the PyInstaller spec file to include these.

#### Example spec file (`main.spec`):
```python
# -*- mode: python ; coding: utf-8 -*-

block_cipher = None

a = Analysis(
    ['main.py'],
    pathex=[],
    binaries=[],
    datas=[('resources', 'resources')],
    hiddenimports=[],
    hookspath=[],
    runtime_hooks=[],
    excludes=[],
    win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
    win_private_assemblies=False,
    cipher=block_cipher,
)
pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data, cipher=block_cipher)

exe = EXE(
    pyz,
    a.scripts,
    [],
    exclude_binaries=True,
    name='main',
    debug=False,
    bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    console=False,
    disable_windowed_traceback=False,
    target_arch=None,
    codesign_identity=None,
    entitlements_file=None,
)

coll = COLLECT(
    exe,
    a.binaries,
    a.zipfiles,
    a.datas,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    upx_exclude=[],
    name='main',
)
```
Run PyInstaller with this spec file:
```sh
pyinstaller main.spec
```

### Step 3: Create Executable for Ubuntu
1. **Install cx_Freeze**:
    ```sh
    pip install cx_Freeze
    ```

2. **Create Setup Script**:
    Create a `setup.py` script in your project directory.

#### `setup.py`:
```python
import sys
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

build_exe_options = {
    "packages": ["pygame", "tkinter"],
    "include_files": [("resources", "resources")],
}

setup(
    name="SOS Game",
    version="0.1",
    description="SOS Game created with Pygame and Tkinter",
    options={"build_exe": build_exe_options},
    executables=[Executable("main.py", base=None)],
)
```

3. **Build Executable**:
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```sh
    python setup.py build
    ```

### Step 4: Package for Distribution
#### On Windows:
1. Use Inno Setup or a similar tool to create an installer for your Windows executable.
2. Include the `dist` folder and all dependencies.

#### On Ubuntu:
1. Create a Debian package (`.deb`):
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install checkinstall
    sudo checkinstall --pkgname=sos-game --pkgversion=1.0 --backup=no --deldoc=yes --fstrans=no --default python setup.py install
    ```

### Additional Notes:
- **Fonts**: Ensure any custom fonts are included in the `resources` directory and referenced correctly in your code.
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed before running PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

Following these steps will allow you to create installation files for both Windows and Ubuntu. This will help users install and run your SOS game easily.
